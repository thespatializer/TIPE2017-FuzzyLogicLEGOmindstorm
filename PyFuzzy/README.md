# PyFuzzy
From that directory, every element is supposed to be placed on the LEGO Mindstorm storage (i.e. the SD Card, e.g. in the user's "home" directory).
The Python PyFuzzy library is supposed to be installed on the device as well as the ANTLR3 package.
You can get the documentation and sources from here :
[PyFuzzy](http://pyfuzzy.sourceforge.net)
[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/)

_NB: At that time (mid-2017), PyFuzzy 0.1 was used and supported ANTLR3. __Do not__ use ANTLR4 with PyFuzzy 0.1, it will not work._
