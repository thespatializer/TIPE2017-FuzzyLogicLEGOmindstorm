# TIPE2017-FuzzyLogicLEGOmindstorm
Project lead during the course of my TIPE for CPGE TSI (France). The subject was to answer if fuzzy logic was a pertinent solution to predict and prevent a collision for a prototype of autonomous vehicle.

## USAGE
These files are meant to be used on a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 brick booting on the debian-based ev3dev hack which documentation can be found [here](http://www.ev3dev.org/ "ev3dev website").
You will need to install Python3 if it is not already distributed and check if the ev3dev library needs to be added.

## DEMONSTRATION PROTOTYPE
These programs have been used on a LEGO Mindstorm construction.
Here are pictures of the prototype :
